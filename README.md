# Stress-and-Strain-Analysis-in-Elastic-Phantoms
This project performs mechanical analysis on elastic phantoms that simulate soft tissues. Using Python, the code calculates and visualizes the relationship between stress and strain, generating graphs and estimating Young's Modulus. It also interprets 3D displacement data to assess the rigidity and elasticity of the materials.
